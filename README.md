Computer Systems Engineering Student | Passionate about Back-end, Data Science and Finance 💻📊💰

I’m currently finishing my degree in Computer Systems Engineering at UAI - Universidad Abierta Interamericana (Buenos Aires), and also enrolled in the Certified Tech Developer program at Digital House.

I'm highly motivated by how technology constantly evolves and how much we still have to discover—especially in areas like Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing. I’m particularly interested in back-end development and how Data Science and Finance can be combined to build smart and innovative solutions.

🔭 I’m currently learning:
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and ReactJS (at CTD)
- .NET with C# (at university)

💡 Topics that I’m passionate about:
- Back-end development
- Data Science
- Finance and Technology
- Artificial Intelligence
- Quantum Computing

👯 I’d love to collaborate on open source projects and join development teams to grow and learn from others.

⚡ Fun fact:  
_"Every minute is a chance to change everything."_

💬 Outside tech:  
I’m a private airplane pilot ✈️, I enjoy skydiving 🪂, water sports 🌊, and spending time with friends over mates and barbecues 🧉🔥.
